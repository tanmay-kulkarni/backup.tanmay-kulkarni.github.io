# Hello, world!

I'm a software engineer specializing in machine learning and data science. I have 3 years of industry experience. 
Here's my [resume](projects/resume-data-science.pdf). You can reach me via email at: **`ucanreachtvk [at] gmail [dot] com`**

Here are some of my projects -

________________







### 1. [Personalized Medicine - Redefining Cancer Treatment](projects/case_study_1.html)
	
> Classifying Cancer tumor into 9 distinct classes based on Genetic mutations. A multi-class classification problem based on the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/data) provided by MSKCC
