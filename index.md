# Hello, world!

I'm a software engineer specializing in machine learning and data science. I have 3 years of industry experience. 
Here's my [resume](projects/resume-data-science.pdf). You can reach me via email at: **`ucanreachtvk [at] gmail [dot] com`**

Following are some of my projects. I mainly use tools available in the open source Python stack which include: **`scikit-learn`**, **`nltk`**,**`NumPy`**, **`Pandas`**, **`Matplotlib`**, **`Seaborn`**.

Throughout these projects I've carried out some common tasks typically performed in a data science project such as - 
		
	#/~ Data Cleaning 
	#/~ Statistical Analysis
	#/~ Natural Language Processing 
	#/~ Dimensionality Reduction
	#/~ Feature Engineering
	#/~ Data Visualization
	#/~ Supervised Learning
	#/~ Unsupervised Learning
	#/~ Hyperparameter Tuning
	
Do take a look! &#x1F642;

## 1. [Personalized Medicine - Redefining Cancer Treatment](projects/hb.html)
	
> #### **SUMMARY :**

> Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) has published a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/data) that contains instances of gene mutations labeled by experts and the literature they used to classify the cases into one of the nine categories. 

> This manual classification is a laborious and time consuming task. The goal is to replace it with a machine learning process.

> I used `Logistic Regression, Random Forests, KNN and SVM` for this task and was able to get a `logloss` score of ___.

## 2. [Predicting the demand for cabs in New York City](projects/case_study_2.html)
	
> #### **SUMMARY :**

> With the rise of taxi services such as Ola and Uber, commuting in urban areas has become more convenient than ever. It has also created a lot of jobs for people. Now, the earning capacity of a driver depends a lot on the number of pickups he makes per day.  

> The objective of this study is to predict in a time bound manner the possible pickups in a region so that a driver can decide which area to park his vehicle in to get the maximum number of passengers.

> I've used the historical data provided by the NYC taxi and Limousine commission for training some ML models.

## 5. Classifying Amazon Food Reviews dataset
Amazon has published a dataset of food items it sold on its website for more than ten years leading upto 2012. The dataset contains ~500,000 reviews, among other features, written by users who purchased those items. In this project, I've tried to apply various Machine Learning techniques I know to classify the reviews into positive and negative. I was able to achieve a satisfactory **`Precision`** and **`Recall`** of > 80%.
