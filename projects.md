|1. [Taxi demand prediction](../project_files/case_study_2.html)|
--------------------------|----------------------------
| Can we predict with reasonable accuracy, the number of taxis that need to be present at location `l` at time `t`? In this project, I've tried to solve this problem on the [New York Taxis data](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml), with some time series analysis, basic statistics and some machine learning.|

|2. [Classifying Cancer Tumors](../project_files/case_study_1.html)|
--------------------------|----------------------------
| **Description**: This is my attempt at solving the kaggle problem described [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/). I was able to achieve an accuracy of 98.68% and a `loglos` of 0.0643.|

|3. [Stack Overflow Tag prediction](../project_files/sotp.html)|
--------------------------|----------------------------
| **Description**: This is my attempt at solving the kaggle problem described [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/). I was able to achieve an accuracy of 98.68% and a `loglos` of 0.0643.|

|4. [Microsoft Malware Detection](../project_files/malware.html)|
--------------------------|----------------------------
| **Description**: Solving the Microsoft Malware classification challenge found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/). I was able to achieve an accuracy.|

* [Predicting the outcome of a Cricket game](../project_files/Cricket.html)
	- This was actually a problem statement given to me in an interview. The requirement was to just draw a flow chart to explain the approach. I expanded the scope of it and used an actual dataset available on Kaggle to demonstrate some EDA and ML.

* [Implementing Gradient Descent](../project_files/gd_1.html)
	- Implemented the Gradient Descent algorithm for a linear regression case.

* [Statistical Analysis using Python](../project_files/statistics.html)
	- Basic statistics using Python to understand distributions of data, and Hypothesis testing.

* [Mammographic Masses Classification](../project_files/mammographic_masses_classification.html)

* [Word vectors using Truncated SVD](../project_files/random/Word_Vectors_using_Truncated_SVD.html)

* My journey into understanding **_Neural Networks_**
	- [A very simple Neural Network to get started](../project_files/dl/simplest_nn.html)
	- [Predicting house price using a simple Neural Network](../project_files/dl/house_price.html)
	- The Hello world of Neural Nets - MNIST
		- [Multilayered Perceptron](../project_files/dl/mnist.html)
		- [Using a ConvNet](../project_files/dl/mnist_cnn.html)
		- [Fasion MNIST](../project_files/dl/fasion_mnist.html)



|6. Amazon Fine Food Reviews|
--------------------------|----------------------------
|  The "Amazon Fine Food Reviews" is a dataset that contains customer reviews collected for more than 10 years by Amazon. The objective of this project is to classify the reviews as positive or negative. I've tried various ML techniques for this which are listed below. You can find the original dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-review).
